# run-muma-run

This is a fashion photography project following Muma, a player. 
Everyone gets to play in the world. 
When they do, they each arrive in cubes, that is their space of reality.
When they finish the game, their cube disintegrates into smaller cubes, thus fragmenting the initial reality into more realities.
Hence, although the game is finished, the reality is neither destroyed, or created. 
It has always been there, all along.


To run, install npm and use npm run dev to run on a localhost.
